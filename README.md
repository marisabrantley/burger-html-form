# Burger Order Form Project

## Objective

#### Hungry for a burger? If not, you will be after filling out this form! :hamburger:


This burger order form was created as part of a lesson about HTML forms, action and method attributes, label and input elements, and setting the type attributes for the fields.

This form specifically includes the list, number input, range, checkbox, radio type, textarea, and submit attributes.

The lesson discussed form validation, specifically HTML5 built-in client-side validation. The required attribute and setting a minimum and maximum value for a number field are also used on this form.

While creating the GitHub Page for this project, I learned GitHub returns a "405 Not Allowed" error when trying to submit HTML form post requests. Instead, I omitted the action and method attributes and added a button and link to the submission page.

I also made the logo on Canva.
